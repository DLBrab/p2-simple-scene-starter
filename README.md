"Ice Caves" - A simple generation that generates something resembling the bizarre curvature of ice caves.

Randomness: The generation uses randomness to adjust the placements of the individual ellipses to create some visual nonconformity. It also creates variation on the shapes of the ellipses.
Reactivity: The scene reacts to mouse movement by adjusting the offset of shading circles, to (attempt to) recreate the movement of a light source on the reflective ice walls.

Artist statement: I wanted to make the wonderful curvatures present in ice caves, and allow for the movement of light to reflect upon them. However, my knowledge of what makes shading look nice is extremely limited, and the inspiration image I used is probably better for an ARTG major than a CSGD major like myself. Additionally, as this is my first foray into P5js, I have limited knowledge on what the code base offers me to do what I'm trying to do.
